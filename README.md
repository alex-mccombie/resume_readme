Values
	- **Uptime** :  I know exactly how online my system are, and upgrade them past 100%
	- **Signal to noise** : I am able to filter real world noise and focus on what is important.
	- **Machine Learning** : I observe and record all available data to reveal reality.
	
	* **Turing tested** - In an environment of video meetings, I can pass as a human.
	
	* **Remote access** - I work better remotely. The proof is in the code I post.
	
	* **Broadcasting** - I care about growing userbases.  The more the merrier!
	
	* **Client driven** - I am willing to bug people in IT so that customers get a seamless experience.

- Experience
	- I’ve written so many lines of code.  If someone explains some new data or answer they are trying to find, my mind immediately starts devising a digital creation to solve the problem, and how I can best explain this to the next computer I meet.  I like to code.
 	- I am really easy-going about everything except software.  I want to be able to create useful applications for millions of people - I want it to work first time every time - I want it to be simple and beautiful.   I am a futurist - I want technology to live up to its promise of becoming indistinguishable from magic - which will require beautifully designed software.

- Working remotely
	- Some people have difficulties with remote work.   Not me - that's where I do my best work.
	- I like meetings that involve a lot of screen sharing of working prototypes and solutions.
	- A coders work can be judged from anywhere.
	- I am happy in any role where I am judged by my code.

- Meaningful work
	- Solving human problems is the purpose of all business and technology.  
	- I love innovation, and innovative industries - renewable energy, machine learning,  graphics and VR, gaming are all fields I can really throw myself at.  
	- Sustainable businesses grow by solving a problem, and adding to collective human happiness.   I aim to over-perform, but I want to over-perform in an ethical industry that the world really needs.   

- Tuned In
	- Remote work also means I get to choose my soundtrack.  
	- Software is more than the code itself - it’s a delicate web of implied connections created by the shape of the code.   I have specific tracks (links below) I use to get into a coding state of mind so I can see the imaginary connections.   It’s much easier to modify complex behaviours and write code that fits a new design when you have a clear image of it.   The music has just become part of the toolkit over the years.

- Performance coder
	- As a coder, I am always aware of my audience.  
	- They are going to experience my work, and the aim is to code something they will love.   Coding in the cloud age has become a performance art.   When there is an audience with an urgent problem, the solution is sometimes just a short code sprint away.   Wherever possible, I will collapse deadlines with a 10x result using a shortcut no-one else saw.

- User Friendly
	- I also understand that most people don’t really give a flying _fig_ about software.
	- They just want the software to work so they can get on with their day.   
	- I speak fluent computerese as a second language, but I try to avoid speaking it around humans.
	- I don’t want to fill this resume with a list of every tech that has been released in the last 30 years, but you can safely assume I’ve worked with it, and I am always interested in conquering more. 
	- The most magical feature of software is not in the details - it is hiding the details and making life simpler for real people.

## Work history
- My father was a programmer for IBM.  He would bring home some of the latest tech for me to play with - including some of the first IBM PCs in the country.   I was fascinated with the idea that I could tell a computer to do something and it would *have to do it*.     When I couldn’t be at my computer, I would be designing software on the back pages of school notepads.   
- I’ve written code solving a wide range of business problems for some big clients:  Origin Energy |  BHP | Brambles | Telstra | KPMG
- I've written for any platform I can get my hands on - C++,  assembly code, node, mobile phones, kiosks, arduino, VR headsets, cloud, containers - they are all parts of the world I can control with software.   
- Running my own saas operation and overseeing the whole process from start to finish has been an education - lots of freedom but also a lot of hats to wear.    I want to be part of a team of experts where I can specialise in creating code, so I get to flex my skills.
- Our civilization is being gradually automated - coding is no longer just an abstract business function - the future is made of software.

### Howsafe - Kiosk OS
- Howsafe is a WHS consultancy that manages large industrial clients up and down the east coast states. 
- I was brought in to rescue a gateway kiosk project that had been left in an unfinished state after 18 months of development.   I was told it only needed “a bit of a fix” - what they really had was an electron-based stand-alone prototype with no network layer.    
- I pulled the prototype apart, and I re-implemented it in node, mongodb and reactjs.   A look-alike prototype of it was available in the first week, which was used by an online team to develop the concept and test the result.
- Each kiosk has a 42 inch industrial touchscreen powered by an embedded Intel NUC,
running a custom local server.   It acts as a sensor platform that hosts a video camera, a thermal sensor, a blood-alcohol tester, fingerprint reader, a sticker printer and a QR code scanner.  The software platform combines them all into a multi-factor site access point.    
- Its fun to build physical devices.   I’d be interested in  doing more work that ties together sensor platforms, robotics and IOT.

>Northpower | Origin Energy | Coder Analyst  | 1997-2000
SQL, pascal, C++, Delphi, Oracle, unix
- Northpower was formed from the merger of nine large councils and their electricity infrastructure into a single energy company covering most of regional NSW. I was assigned to the stores project, and then promoted to manage, conversion of the stores / material management system from a vt-100 terminal system into a modern GUI.
- The project had stalled, as the vendor’s GUI system proved incapable of managing concurrent transactions. Each council had its own stores systems of thousands of stock items that needed to be rationalised into a single companywide system. Stores depots were often in remote locations operating over unreliable ADSL copper, and the chosen platform struggled even on a LAN connection. Staff were becoming sceptical that a working system was even possible.
- I developed a radically simpler database client that did not require record locking -  it was robust enough to work at remote store locations over intermittent network connections.   This client/server model became the standard client model for other teams, and the overall conversion resulted in a system that turned nine electricity providers into one statewide provider.
---
>Hastings Council | Data Analyst / Coder | 1996-1997
pascal, Delphi, DEC unix, SQL
- Created financial modelling tools for pricing wholesale electricity, and visualising trends and modelling different pricing scenarios. From here I was transferred to the conversion of a vt-100 minicomputer system, being given responsibility for their stores and material logistics system.

>Brambles Industrial Services | Business Analyst / Coder | 1992-1993 |
Borland pascal, visual basic, SQL
- Created a rostering / activity tracking / payroll system for the transport division.
- I converted a complex union-mandated paper system of distributing overtime work that required three administrative staff to manage, into a real-time rostering system that could be managed by a single staff member.

Appendix: Read/Write Coding Style.

This was a top-rated solution to a problem on codewars.com:
```
function DUPLICATE_COUNT(text){
return [...new Set([...text.toLowerCase()].sort().filter((c,p,a)=>c===a[p-1]))].length
}
```
Clever coding tricks allow you to write powerful one-liners.
I generally avoid them.   They are so clever they defy understanding.     
Apparently this one-liner is "a function that counts duplicate characters in a string."   
 I’m impressed at the sheer work that one line can do, but I would refer to it as “write-only” code - because even if you can write it, no-one else can read it.  

My solution would be more like this:
```
function DUPLICATE_COUNT(text){
// Return the number of repeated characters in the input string
	let CharCounts={};
	for(let a=0;a<text.length;a++){
		let TheChar=text[a].toUpperCase();
		if(!(TheChar in CharCounts)){ CharCounts[TheChar]=0 };
		CharCounts[TheChar]++;
	};
	let CharCountsKeys=Object.keys(CharCounts);
	let DuplicateCount=0;
	for(let a=0;a<CharCountsKeys.length;a++){
		if(CharCounts[CharCountsKeys[a]]>1){ DuplicateCount++ };
	}
	return(DuplicateCount);
}
```
- Production code gets written once, but will need to be read many times.
- Meaningful variable names allow the function to read like a flowchart.
- That one-liner probably took lots of experimentation to get right, and it would be hard to predict how it would react to slight variations in the source data.
- My version actually runs a bit faster too, because it's simple and optimises well.

Appendix: VR Coding Experiments.

Here’s a collection of VR prototypes I have built as experiments, just to see what the technology allows.  This is not unreal or unity or steam - these interactive 3D spaces are just webGL running in chrome.   Under the hood it is javascript controlling the GPU.    This is interactive GPU powered 3D spaces loaded on demand.    All built from raw code and html and three.js.

>Multimedia Arts Space - Freely explore a virtual art gallery, with thousands of paintings, music, streamed video and interactive exhibits.

>VR Hearted Demos showcase - A platform that magically melds multiple interactive 3D sub-spaces into a single larger space. The content of each sub-space remains fully interactive as an object in the space. The content is not pre-compiled - you can freely extend the space with more sub-spaces without leaving the space.

This is just visual proof I can code.   I also do robust lightning quick vanilla databases, including all the database infrastructure behind these demos.   If your mission involves computation, I am confident I can contribute.
